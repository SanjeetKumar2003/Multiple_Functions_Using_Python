#Problem Statement


You are a data analyst working for a renewable energy company.
The company wants to compare the power output of different types of solar
panels over a 24-hour period.
You have been given data for three types of solar panels: monocrystalline,
polycrystalline, and thin-film.
Your task is to create a multi-line graph that visualizes the power output of
these three types of solar panels from 0 to 24 hours.
The data should be generated within your code using the following
guidelines:
Time range: 0 to 24 hours (x-axis)
Power output range: 0 to 100 watts (y-axis)
Monocrystalline panels: Highest efficiency, peaking around midday
Polycrystalline panels: Slightly lower efficiency than monocrystalline
Thin-film panels: Lower efficiency but more consistent throughout the day
Create a Python script that generates this data and plots a multi-line graph
with the following requirements:
Use appropriate libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
Generate data points for each hour from 0 to 24.
Create three lines on the graph, one for each type of solar panel.
Include a legend to identify each line.
Label the x-axis as "Time (hours)" and the y-axis as "Power Output
(watts)".
Give the graph an appropriate title.
Use different colors and/or line styles to distinguish between the three types
of panels.
Your code should be efficient, well-commented, and follow Python best
practices.
